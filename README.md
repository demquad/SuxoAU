## SuxoAU Defender

This is a local-side version of SelfAC that includes:
 - Protection against being killed by other players due to unusual behavior, with automatic counterattack using 10 RPC calls against the attacker.

**Here what happends when a player kills u**
- Note: After the counterattack, theres a **HIGH** chance the attacker will be kicked from the game, just like in the image below:

**Note:** 
- This feature is still in the testing phase and may not work perfectly in all situations. Im actively working to improve it.
